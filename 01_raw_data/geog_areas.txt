Hi Nick,

As someone with 1 kid, three sounds like a lot of kids!

See geography and treefile attached, hopefully format and names all match up - let me know if any issues.

Codes are as follows -
O=Australia
N=New Guinea
W = Wallacea
E - East Melanesia
P = Pacific
A = Asia

We have also run a reduced analysis just focusing on islands versus continents, but I think this 6 region analysis is probably the place to start.

Looking forward seeing what you come up with. Might be best to run a quickie analysis first to see there are any coding issues that I have missed.

Also keen to know if you have any issues with MS as it stands.

Best
